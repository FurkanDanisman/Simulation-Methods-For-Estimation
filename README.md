# Simulation-Methods-For-Estimation

In this study, by implementing the regular Monte Carlo, importance sampling, and stratified
sampling with both optimal and non-optimal approaches, the following function was used to
estimate I.
$𝜑(𝑥) = (4 − 𝑥^2)𝑒{3−𝑥^2}$  ; $𝑥 ∈ [0,1]$
Hence, by taking the integral of 0 to 1, we can calculate the theoretical value of I, which is:
I = $\int_{0}^{1}$ 𝜑(𝑥) 𝑑𝑥 = 56.19551…
The results of the methods will be both numerically and visually demonstrated in the next part.
